    <h1>That time I turned into a TITAN!!!</h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            It was a sunny day and the battle was still raging on. Years of being captive inside the three walls was had
            made the people of Shiganshina take up arms and fight the war themselves. I was one of the soldiers
            recruited to help fight this war which seemed like a lost cause. The only reason this war was being fought
            was because the people thought it better to die on the battlefield than to die like cattle inside the walls.
            Man eating humanoid titans were scattered on the battlefield. In front of them we looked like bugs who would
            be crushed in an instant. But we couldn't have been more motivated and prepared gaining knowledge from years
            of insight provided by men and women like us who fought with the titans and became legends. The deaths of
            our closed ones had filled my heart with rage and anguish and I wanted to finish every living titan on this
            planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            For weapons, we had titan flesh cutting swords and an equipment which would cling on to the tallest of walls
            and make maneuvering easy as the titans were as big as 12 meters in height starting from 4 meters. Compared
            to that an
            average human height is a mere 1.77 meters. The only way to stop them was if we cut their
            necks from behind which would kill them instantly. Attacking them anywhere else was futile as their body
            parts grew within minutes. This was my first real battle and the gruesomeness made me numb. I would be lying
            if I said I feared no one. The giant titans looked like horrifying killing machines and to see them crush
            and eat my fellow soldiers made my heart stop. Yet, the voice in the back of my head said if you don't carry
            on, the same would happen with your family and friends. I moved with courageous valor with all my energy and
            in an instant I was using my vertical maneuvering equipment to climb the walls and fight the titans. I
            successfully killed a couple of titans until I faced the biggest and fastest of them all.
        </p>
        <p>The titan was 8 meters tall and inspite of it's height it moved surprisingly faster than the others. I
            thought, <q>If we take him down, we win this battle right here.</q> The titan was busy fighting on
            it's right
            side where a soldier was trying to move past him in vain. In a flash, the titan caught the soldier and tore
            his body in half. I moved from his left thinking the titan would be distracted and I would be able to get
            behind it. To my greatest misfortune I had miscalculated the distance it required to get behind the titan as
            I became pale looking at the sight of the soldier getting torn like a piece of paper and to top it off, the
            titan I
            was facing seemed to grasp situations quicker than the others. It understood my movements and moved it's
            head quickly to it's left and before I knew, it had bit my leg off. The pain was excruciating and I tried to
            fend it off and somehow save myself from getting grasped in it's huge palm. I wasn't so lucky as it caught
            me
            almost immediately. My best friend who was battling another titan rushed to my rescue seeing all that was
            going on with me. He tried to battle the titan himself so as to save me but I, sensing that it would be the
            end of both of us pushed him away from the trajectory of the titans hand and let it catch me. My friend
            cried out for help but I knew my end was near. The titan had already put me in it's mouth and gulped me.
            Within seconds, the titan's body broke into pieces and emerging out of it was a new titan. Even after being
            eaten alive when I opened my eyes I saw the entire battlefield but with a titan's point of view. The titan
            that emerged from the giant titan was none other than me. It took some time to get a grasp of the situation
            but I finally realized.
            <q>I was a TITAN!!!</q>
        </p>
        <p> Everything blacked out as soon as the titan ate me. Death was near and I heard my friend and colleagues who
            had died in battle calling me to join them in the afterlife. <q>Is this the end? Is this how I am going
                to die?
                Did I make a difference at all?</q> My entire life flashed in front of my eyes before everything
            started to
            become a blur. I remembered my training where we had spent hours everyday simulating situations we would
            encounter on the battlefield. I was realizing why soldiers die inspite of training so hard. Nothing can
            propare you for real battle. It's your presence of mind along with battle skills that can save
            you. I was one of the
            averagely skilled ones. All of a sudden my eyes were wide open and I could see the war with my own eyes.
            <q>Am
                I dead? Am I able to watch this war from the sky?</q> Before I could think of the answer my eyes
            turned towards
            my best friend who was still in shock over my death. As I looked at him he couldn't make sense of anything
            that was happening in front of him. How a titan emerged from another titan and why was this titan not
            attacking him like all titans normally do when they see a human? I couldn't make sense of this either as I
            hadn't realized that I was the titan he was looking at. I called out to him in my deep titan voice and he
            couldn't believe his ears when he heard me. <q>A titan can speak? And how would the titan know his name?
            </q> I
            called him out by his name. "It's me. I am alive."
